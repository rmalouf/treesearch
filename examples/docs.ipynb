      "like : Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission's priorities in the field of transport.\n",
      "said : As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.\n",
      "like : In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.\n",
      "led : Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.\n",
      "have : Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.\n",
      "like : Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.\n",
      "have : Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.\n",

      "like : But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.\n",
      "say : As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.\n",
      "wait : As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.\n",

      "entered : Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European committee for standardisation.\n",
      "making : Delays in the CEN's work are now making it difficult to apply this very Directive.\n",
      "adapted : In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.\n",
      "having : I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.\n",
      "fail : Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.\n",
      "relate : Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.\n",
      "like : We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.\n",

      "continue : A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.\n",
      "like : I would like to briefly comment on the Commission's proposal to amend the Directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.\n",
      "have : It is good that this Directive should be established now, as, otherwise, member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.\n",
      "fall : On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.\n",
      "is : There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.\n",
      "proposed : I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40° C.\n",
      "were : This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.\n",
      "like : Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.\n",
      "thought : I thought that it was quite superb.\n",
      "think : On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.\n",
      "doing : What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.\n",
      "pointed : The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the Directive.\n",
      "been : The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the Directive.\n",

      "believe : Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.\n",
      "like : I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda's comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.\n",

      "is : We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.\n",

      "ensures : Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.\n",
      "believe : This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.\n",
      "speak : Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.\n",
      "live : We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.\n",
      "remain : We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.\n",
      "like : Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.\n",
      "used : Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.\n",
      "like : I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.\n",
      "deal : These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.\n",
      "fit : These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.\n",
      "hope : We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.\n",
      "lacking : In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.\n",
      "refer : The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.\n",
      "hope : We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.\n",
      "like : I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us:\n",
      "lacks : This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.\n",
      "disappearing : It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.\n",
      "believe : In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.\n",

      "like : I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.\n",

      "discussing : In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.\n",

      "stated : The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.\n",

      "sitting : Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission's offices for several months.\n",

      "drops : The problem is that the rate drops sharply from 71% to 57% among women in their 30's, as inflexible working environments and a lack of affordable childcare undermine their ability to continue investing in their careers.\n",
      "working : The good news is that Park's government is working to change this.\n",
      "contribute : But, given that South Korea's workforce already includes a substantial share of non-regular workers, increasing temporary employment may not contribute to economic growth.\n",

      "began : According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".\n",
      "Ends : In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.\n",
      "believe : Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art.\n",
      "begins : The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be;\n",
      "followed : Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.\n",

      "turned : In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays:\n",
      "end : Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.\n",
      "reveals : The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.\n",

      "performed : After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.\n",
      "allowed : The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices.\n",
      "appeared : Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions — flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.\n",
      "suggests : No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".\n",

      "believe : Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.\n",
      "seems : He seems to have planned two contrasting series:\n",
      "believed : It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets\"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\".\n",
      "spring : He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.\n",
      "depends : The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical — written for actors to declaim rather than speak.\n",

      "looks : At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.\n",
      "begun : By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the Mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry.\n",
      "meant : In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable.\n",
      "tend : It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.\n",

      "darts : In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another.\n",
