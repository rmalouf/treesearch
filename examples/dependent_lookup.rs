//! Example demonstrating the Word::children_by_deprel API
//!
//! NOTE: This example is currently DISABLED because it needs to be rewritten
//! for the current API. The old API with `Node` and manual tree construction
//! has been replaced with `Word` and CoNLL-U based tree construction.
//!
//! This will be updated once the CSP solver is complete.
//!
//! Run with: cargo run --example dependent_lookup
